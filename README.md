Revolutionizing Land Ownership: The Future of Smart Land Registration for Seamless Cities
I was initially unsure about which project to focus on, but then I had a flashback to my childhood. I grew up in a bustling city, surrounded by skyscrapers and concrete jungles. However, my fondest memories were of visiting my grandparents' countryside home during holidays. It was a picturesque place, nestled amidst rolling hills and lush green meadows.
I would spend hours exploring the vast fields, breathing in the fresh country air, and gazing at the starry night sky. But what truly captivated me was the rustic charm of my grandparents' old farmhouse. It had been in our family for generations, and I realized how important it was to ensure its legacy for future generations.
This childhood connection to rural landscapes and the nostalgia of those holidays made me realize the significance of land registration. I decided to take on the land registration application project to help preserve and protect the rich heritage of family-owned properties and ensure that the stories woven into the land are passed down to the next generation.
About the project
My project helps landowners tell their story. It will give specific details about the land on sale as well as help in the quick transfer of the land ownership using digital deeds. I am working on this project by myself. As an engineering problem, we wanted to focus on 2 things: creating an experience that would be both web and mobile-friendly, and also sourcing a reliable and sophisticated API.
